                      The piano teaching method I use most is Alfred's.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-2xl text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 text-center py-2">

                    <p>
                      I will add technique, exercise, and/or scale books, along with other piano music on occasion to the basic lesson and theory books, as the student becomes more skilled and when I think they are ready for extra learning and fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I try to keep it simple in the beginning to not overload and so I can assess the learning level and pace, as well as keep the desire and interest going. Ultimately, it is about the joy of playing the music.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Practice is a necessary discipline. For the adult learner, we will work together to develop a practice plan. The young student generally requires extra encouragement to practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As with all education for our children, we as the parents desire to be involved and participate in the learning process. I am speaking to the music lesson process. It is helpful to have the parent work with the young student to find the best daily practice time, and then have it marked on a calendar or daily schedule. This will help the student to make piano practice time a daily habit.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-eb-garamond text-brown-600">Rates and Materials</h3>
                <p>
                  My current rate for each student is $20 per half hour, plus the cost of the piano books, 
                  usually a lesson, theory, and performance books.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-eb-garamond text-brown-600">First Lesson</h3>
                <p>
                  The first lesson is free so that you and/or the student can decide if I'm the right teacher. 
                  Should you decide to continue, the next lesson and onward is for pay.

                <p>
                  I do not require a contract for any time period, it is month to month. If you decide it is 
                  no longer a good fit, or for any other reason, just let me know and we'll end the lessons.

                <p>
                  I'm fine, with a bit of advanced notice, to reschedule for another day that same week, 
                  availability permitting. Otherwise we just skip the lesson for that week, which means more 
                  time to practice. I am flexible and always allow for sick days.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-eb-garamond text-brown-600">Practice Time Guidelines</h3>
                <p>
                  Each student is unique. The young child should have time to practice at least 15-30 minutes 
                  a day in the beginning. The older child and adult should have time to practice at least 
                  30 - 45 minutes a day in the first weeks. Hands and fingers will get tired, this is normal.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-eb-garamond text-brown-600">Building Consistency</h3>
                <p>
                  Students will build strength with consistent practice. I encourage students to practice 
                  every day, but sometimes that may not be possible, yet even playing the song(s) a couple 
                  times, which might not be longer than 5 minutes at the keyboard during that day, is good; 
                  it is still considered practice.

                <h3 className="text-2xl font-eb-garamond text-brown-600">Benefits of Daily Practice</h3>
                <p>
                  Daily experience at the keyboard is good for the student's hands, ears, eyes, and mind. 
                  As they progress, so should their daily practice time. As a matter of course, focused and 
                  consistent practice develops a greater understanding of the music and one becomes a better musician.
